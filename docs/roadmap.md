## Phase 1 — Core payment API

All Phase 1 work is bound by `docs/explanation/payment-compliance.md` and must
pass `docs/review/compliance.md`.

- [x] NENE2 runtime scaffold (front controller, RuntimeServiceProvider, `GET /health`, composer check green) — Issue #26
- [x] Multi-tenant runtime: `Organization` + tenant resolution (`OrgResolverMiddleware` + strategies) → `RequestScopedHolder` (ADR 0018) — Issue #28
- [x] User auth (`BearerAuthMiddleware` + `LocalBearerTokenVerifier`, login/me) + `Role`/`Capability` + `CapabilityMiddleware` (users migration) — Issue #30
- [x] Vendor management CRUD (audited, 1-tx, soft-deactivate, registration_number record & link only) — Issue #34
- [x] ReceivedInvoice CRUD (audited, pending-only edit, void semantics, tax breakdown record-only) — Issue #36
- [x] ReceivedInvoice PDF upload (multipart, local storage, audited) — Issue #38
- [x] Payment gateway adapter interface (`PaymentGatewayInterface` + ChargeRequest/Result, stub adapter) — Issue #40 (instruction only; no PAN — ADR 0009, 0010)
- [ ] Stripe adapter (hosted charge + verify)
- [x] PaymentExecution create + invoice→processing (initiate, audited, 1-tx) — Issue #40 (immutable terminal records — ADR 0013)
- [x] Audit foundation (`Ulid`, `AuditRecorder`, audit_logs migration, `GET /api/v1/audit-logs`); mutation+audit transaction wiring applied per resource — ADR 0011 — Issue #32
- [ ] UTC storage / JST display bootstrap (ADR 0012)
- [ ] Webhook handler (payment result from gateway; signature-verified, idempotent)
- [ ] OpenAPI contract validation (composer openapi)

## Compliance follow-ups (gated)

- [ ] Fee / refund / chargeback accounting model + **税理士/会計士 sign-off** (ADR 0015 → follow-up ADR), then implement
- [ ] Launch gateway selection ADR (licensed/contracted entity — ADR 0009)

## Phase 2 — Admin UI + widget

- [ ] React admin UI (FSD per frontend-standards.md / ADR 0019: received invoice list, vendor list, payment history)
- [ ] Embeddable payment widget (script tag embed)
- [ ] CSS variable customization
- [ ] Admin panel: gateway configuration + connectivity check (疎通確認)
- [x] ja / en i18n foundation (shared/i18n catalogs, instant switch, key-parity test — Issue #44); screens pending

## Phase 3 — Tier A deployment

- [ ] Web installer (shared hosting)
- [ ] Release ZIP
- [ ] Operator guide

## Phase 4 — Extended gateways + integrations

- [ ] GMO Payment Gateway adapter
- [ ] nene-suite integration (NENE_SUITE_MODE)
- [ ] nene-vault document link
